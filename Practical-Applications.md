# Practical Applications of Python Concepts

This document of mine  explores **practical applications** of Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data types. These examples demonstrate how Python can be used to solve real-world problems effectively.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **User Input Validation**
Validating user input is a common task in programming. Python’s `while` loops and conditional statements make it easy to ensure that users provide valid data.

#### Example: Age Validation
```python
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        if age < 0:
            print("Age cannot be negative. Try again.")
        else:
            break  # Exit the loop if input is valid
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")

print(f"Your age is: {age}")
```

### 2. **Password Authentication**
Password authentication is a critical feature in many applications. Python’s `if` statements and loops can be used to implement secure login systems.

#### Example: Password Checker
```python
password = "secure123"
attempts = 3

while attempts > 0:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
    if user_input == password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        attempts -= 1
        print(f"Incorrect password. {attempts} attempts remaining.")

if attempts == 0:
    print("Access denied. Please try again later.")
```

### 3. **Data Filtering**
Filtering data is a common task in data analysis. Python’s loops and conditionals can be used to extract specific data from a list.

#### Example: Filter Even Numbers
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = []

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(num)

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

#### Output:
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

---

### 4. **Generating Reports**
Python can be used to generate reports by processing and formatting data.

#### Example: Sales Report
```python
sales = [
    {"product": "Apple", "quantity": 10, "price": 1.50},
    {"product": "Banana", "quantity": 5, "price": 0.75},
    {"product": "Orange", "quantity": 8, "price": 1.25}
]

total_sales = 0

print("Sales Report:")
print("-------------")
for item in sales:
    total = item["quantity"] * item["price"]
    total_sales += total
    print(f"{item['product']}: {item['quantity']} units, Total: ${total:.2f}")

print("-------------")
print(f"Total Sales: ${total_sales:.2f}")
```

#### Output:
```
Sales Report:
-------------
Apple: 10 units, Total: $15.00
Banana: 5 units, Total: $3.75
Orange: 8 units, Total: $10.00
-------------
Total Sales: $28.75
```

### 5. **Game Development**
Python’s loops and conditionals are often used in game development to create interactive experiences.

#### Example: Number Guessing Game
```python
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")

while True:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    attempts += 1

    if guess < number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    elif guess > number:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
    else:
        print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
        break
```

---

### 6. **File Processing**
Python can be used to read, process, and write data to files. This is useful for tasks like log analysis or data transformation.

#### Example: Count Words in a File
```python
filename = "sample.txt"
word_count = 0

with open(filename, "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        words = line.split()
        word_count += len(words)

print(f"Total words in '{filename}': {word_count}")
```

---

### 7. **Web Scraping**
Python’s loops and conditionals are essential for web scraping tasks, where data is extracted from websites.

#### Example: Extract Links from a Web Page
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

print("Links on the page:")
for link in soup.find_all("a"):
    href = link.get("href")
    if href:
        print(href)
```

---

### 8. **Data Visualization**
Python’s loops and conditionals can be used to prepare data for visualization.

#### Example: Generate a Bar Chart
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {"Apples": 10, "Bananas": 5, "Oranges": 8}
plt.bar(data.keys(), data.values())
plt.xlabel("Fruit")
plt.ylabel("Quantity")
plt.title("Fruit Inventory")
plt.show()
```

---

### 9. **Automating Tasks**
Python can automate repetitive tasks, such as renaming files or sending emails.

#### Example: Rename Files in a Directory
```python
import os

directory = "files"
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.endswith(".txt"):
        new_name = filename.replace(".txt", "_backup.txt")
        os.rename(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, new_name))
        print(f"Renamed {filename} to {new_name}")
```

---

### 10. **Building a To-Do List**
Python’s loops and conditionals can be used to create interactive applications, such as a to-do list.

#### Example: To-Do List App
```python
todo_list = []

while True:
    print("\nTo-Do List:")
    for i, task in enumerate(todo_list, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {task}")

    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Add Task")
    print("2. Remove Task")
    print("3. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        task = input("Enter the task: ")
        todo_list.append(task)
    elif choice == "2":
        task_num = int(input("Enter the task number to remove: "))
        if 1 <= task_num <= len(todo_list):
            todo_list.pop(task_num - 1)
        else:
            print("Invalid task number.")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
```
